            <p class="main_left_p">I have my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and my Master's Degree in Computer Science from Clemson University.</p>
            <p>I have had a varied career. I began my engineering career as a switching power supply engineer, transitioned to be an analog hardware designer, and then became a signal transformer designer.</p>
            <p>I was the team leader of the group of hardware engineers who designed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlS7SldS9SU" target="_blank">Vectron Watt-Hour Meter</a>.</p>
            <p>I realized that gaining experience in a field means that, while you know more and more with time, your knowledge becomes more and more specialized until you know everything about nothing.</p>
            <p>I decided to go to graduate school and learn about software engineering while I still knew more than nothing as a way to broaden my knowledge base.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm learning about web page design to again broaden that knowledge base.</p>
